# GitHub User Search

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/standard--readme-OK-green.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

> A cross-platform Ionic implementation of the GitHub user search API

This application uses the public [GitHub search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/) in order to search for users, and is best viewed on mobile.

- Built with the [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/docs)
- [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/) is used to compile to Android and iOS and offer native features such as the in-app browser which is demoed in this project
- Protractor, the default end-to-end test runner, has been replaced with [Cypress](https://cypress.io)
- The [GitHub Scripts to Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern has been implemented to make it easy to jump into the project and get bootstrapped
- This project has been formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is used for hosting (you must generate your own `.firebaserc`)

Future enhancements I would make:

- Responsive web design with utilization of whitespace
- Break down UI into components for pagination, the result list, etc.
- Karma unit tests
- Add models and strongly type as much as possible
